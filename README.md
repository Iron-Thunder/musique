Created a Music Player with React Native where I have learned a lot about synchronous management(async await),  React Native TrackPlayer, constant files and linking functions to do required tasks.
It was fun to make this project as this plays real songs and it works same as a real Music Player.
I have tried to make the UI simple and attractive where user can Immerse themselves in their favorite tunes with this sleek and intuitive Music Player.

Some of the key features of my app are:

Seamless Playback: Enjoy uninterrupted playback of your music library with our smooth and reliable music player.
User-Friendly Interface: Navigate through your music collection effortlessly with our user-friendly interface, designed for ease of use and convenience.
Offline Mode: Take your music with you wherever you go, even when you're offline. Download your favorite tracks and playlists to listen to them anytime, anywhere.
